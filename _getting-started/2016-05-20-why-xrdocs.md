Welcome to @xrdocs!


Cisco IOS-XR 6.0+ brings with it some key operational enhancements in the domains of monitoring, automation, application-hosting and software management. However, these enhancements require the right tools to aid their consumption. 

In our minds, at a macro level we can classify the tools into two types:

* **User end tools/applications**:  eg. YDK-py, Streaming Telemetry plugins for ELK/Prometheus/SignalFX, support for Config-management tools like Ansible, Puppet and Chef, YUM repositories for WRL7 apps etc.
* **Documentation**: Regular Blogs, Step-by-step tutorials and detailed technical documents have to accompany tools. There is probably nothing more infuriating than a badly documented piece of code/tool/feature.
  
  
  
**@xrdocs** has been designed to address these documentation concerns.

*   We needed a platform to quickly churn out relevant documentation and make sure it remains up-to-date with all the changes coming up in IOS-XR. 
*   We wanted to peer-review our documentation, raise bugs against it and give control directly to the technical writers. In short, we wanted to treat documentation like code.

The choice was simple: If you've followed the tremendous success of github-pages ever since its inception, it would be clear that using [github](https://github.com) as a platform to host and edit our documentation-as-code, was the way to go.

So here we are, @xrdocs is up and running at <https://xrdocs.github.io> with links to domains of interest.
